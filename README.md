My version of the [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

## the virtual environment

Virtual environment is called flaskapp, probably should have called venv per convention

$ source flaskapp/bin/activate

## setting up environment variable

$ export FLASK_APP=microblog.py (or use set on windows when not using bash)

## running the app

$ flask run

App then available locally at:

http://localhost:5000/
